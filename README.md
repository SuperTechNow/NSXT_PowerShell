# PowerNSXT
If you come from NSX-v era, you must be familiar with PowerNSX module. 

I myself has been using PowerNSX for couple years and I like it very much. It doesn't only make it very efficient to retrieve information, troubleshoot, and automate build/implementation, but also makes it a lot of fun. 

Over the past couple years, I've built quite some automation scripts that I took pride in for various projects at work using PowerNSX. 

I've always wanted to do something for NSX-T. So here we are. 

This repo is to create a similar module for NSX-T using NSX-T policy API.

I will start with creating some functions for NSX-T Firewall rule creation first.
